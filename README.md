# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

Final laboratory project as part of the Medical Imaging course. Using methods such as Linear Contrast Enchancement, Exponential Function, Dilation, Erosion and Binarization I managed to extract the zones of interest - in this case areas affected by tumors inside the brain - also doing a comparative report documenting the use of methods, as well as State of the Art methods used in the industry.
